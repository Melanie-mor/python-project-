COVID-19 GLOBAL DATA TRACKER PROJECT

  The project will analyze cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time. Learners will clean and process real-world data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate insights, and visualize trends using Python data tools.
 
 OBJECTIVES
  ✅ Collected global COVID-19 data from Our World in Data.
  
  ✅ Loaded and explored the dataset using pandas.
  
  ✅ Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values and filtering relevant countries.
  
  ✅ Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
  
  ✅ Created visualizations (line charts, bar charts, heatmaps, optional choropleth maps) to illustrate key metrics.
  
  ✅ Calculated critical indicators such as death rates and vaccination coverage.
  
  ✅ Presented insights through a well-documented Jupyter Notebook report combining code, visuals, and narrative explanations.

 INSIGHTS
 
  Sample Key Insights:
  
    India showed a rapid increase in vaccinations starting mid-2021, surpassing other selected countries in cumulative numbers.
    Kenya had a slower vaccination rollout, with less than 30% of its population fully vaccinated by the latest recorded date.
    The USA had high total case counts, but maintained a relatively stable death rate compared to earlier pandemic waves.
    Death rates varied across countries, with some maintaining a ratio under 2%, while others peaked during early pandemic phases.
    A noticeable spike in daily new cases was observed in early 2022 across all countries, likely tied to Omicron or variant waves.

  Anomalies or Patterns to Highlight:
  
    Data gaps were found for some countries (e.g., missing vaccination numbers for early 2020), requiring interpolation.
    In some cases, daily new cases dropped sharply, followed by a spike — indicating possible reporting delays or corrections.
    Certain countries like India showed very high daily new cases compared to others during specific periods (Delta wave).
